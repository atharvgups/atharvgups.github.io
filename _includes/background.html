      I've never had experience writing a background/bio type of thing before. So, here's goes <strike> nothing</strike>  something...
    </p>

    <p>
       I'm a rising eight grader who loves listening to 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/5s6cocuc2wi8541o0skac5rf6" target="_blank">music</a> 
      (<a class="underline-link" href="mailto:atharvgups@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>  me and we can talk about it), 
      playing the ukulele & guitar, golfing, 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
